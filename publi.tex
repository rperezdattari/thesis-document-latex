Throughout the development of this thesis two conference papers were written and accepted:

\begin{itemize}
    \item R. Pérez-Dattari, C. Celemin, J. Ruiz-del-Solar, J. Kober. ``Continuous Control for High-Dimensional State Spaces: An Interactive Learning Approach". International Conference on Robotics and Automation \textbf{(ICRA)}. (2019)
    \newline\color{blue}\textbf{Paper available:} \color{black} \url{www.jenskober.de/publications/PerezDattariICRA2019.pdf}
    
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    
    \item R. Pérez-Dattari, C. Celemin, J. Ruiz-del-Solar, J. Kober. ``Interactive Learning with Corrective Feedback for Policies based on Deep Neural Networks". International Symposium on Experimental Robotics \textbf{(ISER)}. (2018)
    \newline\color{blue}\textbf{Paper available:} \color{black} \url{www.arxiv.org/abs/1810.00466}
\end{itemize}

The ISER paper was done with the work present in Chapter 2; the ICRA paper was done with the work present in Chapter 3. In both cases the code was made public through the github platform:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ICRA code:} \url{git.io/fjv2e}
